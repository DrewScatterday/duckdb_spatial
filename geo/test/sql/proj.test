# Note:
# ST_Transform does not read the source SRID from the geometry, but requires it to be passed as a parameter.
# This is because we don't have a SPATIAL_REF_SYS table yet where we can lookup the projection parameters from the SRID.
# Additionally, if you decide to store the SRID in a separate column, you will automatically benefit from
# dictionary compression on strings. This is not possible if you store the SRID in the geometry itself.
